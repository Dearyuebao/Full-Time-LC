6. Performance of ArrayList vs. LinkedList

The time complexity comparison is as follows:
arraylist-vs-linkedlist-complexity

ArrayList:
add O(1)
get O(1)
remove O(n)

LinkedList:
add O(1)
get O(n)
remove O(n)

* add() in the table refers to add(E e), and remove() refers to remove(int index)

ArrayList has O(n) time complexity for arbitrary indices of add/remove, but O(1) for the operation at the end of the list.
LinkedList has O(n) time complexity for arbitrary indices of add/remove, but O(1) for operations at end/beginning of the List.

List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
